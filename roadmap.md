# Roadmap

## Template signature sending
- [x] Remove separate Harmonious approval for generated Harmonious templates; preserve non-template review and signing controls
- [x] Validate template activation and regressions (53 tests; preview compiles)
- [ ] Signed-in review → send → sign walkthrough — blocked: no isolated synthetic QA session; shared production backend cannot be used for browser tests

## User invitation and account insights
- [x] Track successful/failed invitation sends and exact Brevo message outcomes
- [x] Add invite, login, setup filters and clickable invitation/user history
- [x] Show shared insights under client People
- [x] Validate delivery/setup model (13 tests) and clean preview compilation; Brevo read-only delivery lookup verified
- [ ] Authenticated end-to-end invitation/account walkthrough — blocked: no synthetic QA sessions; shared production backend must not be used for browser tests

## Client app and Operations separation
- [x] Complete client/staff address routing without changing permissions
- [x] Distinguish client and staff menus, top bars and sign-in presentation
- [x] Verify address redirects and sign-in screens (93 focused tests; desktop/phone browser checks)
- [ ] Authenticated client/staff click-through — blocked: no synthetic QA sessions available; shared production backend must not be used for browser tests

## Founders Fund (Digital Irish Ventures)
- [x] Setup: add multiple Google Drive links section
